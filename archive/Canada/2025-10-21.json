  "description": "Diwali is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrating hope, prosperity and the triumph of good over evil. It commemorates Prince Rama's victorious return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival also honours the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring wealth and well-being into homes, while some communities worship the goddess Kali. During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolise light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings. One of the most striking places to witness this tradition is Harmandir Sahib, also known as the Golden Temple, in Amritsar, India. A sacred site in Sikhism, it is open to people from all faiths and walks of life.",
