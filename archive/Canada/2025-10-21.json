  "description": "Diwali is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrating hope, prosperity and the triumph of good over evil. It commemorates Prince Rama's victorious return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival also honours the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring wealth and well-being into homes, while some communities worship the goddess Kali. During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolise light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings. One of the most remarkable places to see the lights of the season is Harmandir Sahib, also known as the Golden Temple, in Amritsar, India. This gurdwara, a sacred site in Sikhism, welcomes people of all faiths. Around the time of Diwali, Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas, marking the release of the sixth Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji, from imprisonment.",
