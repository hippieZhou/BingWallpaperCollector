  "description": "This year marks another milestone in the legacy of Yosemite National Park in California, United States, a sanctuary protected since 1864 and celebrated for its awe-inspiring grandeur and ecological significance. Nestled in the heart of the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite's nearly 3,100 square kilometres cradle granite giants, cascading waterfalls and ancient sequoias. Among its lesser-known treasures lies the Clark Range—the rugged, high-elevation spine seen in today's image. It was named after Galen Clark, Yosemite's first guardian and a pioneer of conservation.",
