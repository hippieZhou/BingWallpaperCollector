  "description": "Ever tried spotting a snow leopard in the wild? It's called the 'ghost of the mountains' for a reason—you're more likely to see its pawprints than the big cat itself. But every October 23, the species steps into the spotlight on International Day of the Snow Leopard, a day set aside to protect this elusive predator and its rugged home.",
