  "description": "She was never meant to fade away. When the RMS Queen Mary sailed in 1936, she stole the spotlight across the Atlantic—an Art Deco liner that broke speed records and carried celebrities, royalty and dignitaries. War transformed her from a floating palace into the 'Grey Ghost,' stripped of luxury and loaded with Allied troops. Between 1942 and 1948, the RMS Queen Mary, along with 59 other ships, played a significant role in Canada's post-war history by transporting women and children—known as war brides—from Europe to Canada. In 1967, after 30 years at sea, she retired to Long Beach in California, United States, where her decks now serve as hotel corridors, guided exhibits and a living monument to maritime history.",
