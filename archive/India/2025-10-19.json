  "description": "In Minnesota, United States, autumn carries more than crimson leaves—it brings the crisp promise of apple season. From mid-August through late October, orchards across the state open their rows of Honeycrisp, Haralson and dozens of other cultivars, each bred for flavour, resilience and charm. Today's image captures that moment: branches heavy with ripe fruit, ready for harvest. This land takes its apples seriously. The state apple, the Honeycrisp, now a world favourite, was born in the orchards of the University of Minnesota, where scientists have cultivated apples for over a century.",
