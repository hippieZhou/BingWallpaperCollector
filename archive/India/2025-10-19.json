  "description": "How good would it feel if you could just hang out and do absolutely nothing all day? That's exactly what sloths do. The Hoffmann's two-toed sloth, featured in today's image, is a prime example of this slow-paced lifestyle. Their deliberate movements conserve energy, avoid predators and even allow algae to grow on their fur, creating green camouflage among the canopy.",
