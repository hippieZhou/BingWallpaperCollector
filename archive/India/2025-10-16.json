  "description": "Nestled within Michigan's Rock River Canyon Wilderness in the United States, Rock River Falls emerges amid a landscape shaped by glaciers, dense woods and layers of history. In the Upper Peninsula, humans have left their traces for millennia: Indigenous Algonquian-speaking peoples were followed by French and British explorers and waves of Finnish, Swedish and French-Canadian immigrants settled there during the 19th-century mining and logging booms. Today, this sparsely populated region hosts barely 3% of Michigan's residents, cradling its forests and waterfalls in near-natural serenity.",
