  "description": "Rising above Orchha's skyline, Jahangir Mahal whispers tales of emperors across dynasties. Completed at the close of the 16th century, this grand palace became a symbol of alliance and celebration between the Bundelas and the mighty Mughals. Some believe it was built to commemorate the visit of Emperor Jahangir himself, transforming this fortified marvel into both a royal residence and a ceremonial showpiece. Today, its walls still echo with stories of conquest, camaraderie and courtly splendour.",
