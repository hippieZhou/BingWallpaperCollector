  "description": "From October 4 to 10, World Space Week invites us to transcend our earthly bounds and chase the stars. It was born from the launch of Sputnik 1 by the USSR in 1957 and the signing of the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, a pioneering international commitment to peaceful cosmic exploration. During this week, classrooms buzz with experiments, planetariums echo with wonder and telescopes bridge the gap to distant galaxies. Together, these moments weave a universal story of science, discovery and humanity's relentless drive to push boundaries. The week's mission is clear: to ignite the next generation of explorers, engineers and dreamers ready to rewrite the cosmos.",
