  "description": "Think of a cat that can vanish into the forest without a sound—that's the Eurasian lynx. With its tufted ears and a piercing gaze, this feline is the largest of the four lynx species. Stretching over a metre in length and standing as tall as 75 centimetres at the shoulder, the Eurasian lynx is built for power and precision. Its padded paws aren't just for sneaking; they act like snowshoes, spreading its weight so it can chase down prey in deep winter drifts. Mostly a nocturnal hunter, it spends its days tucked away in thickets or rocky dens, venturing out under the cover of darkness to stalk deer, hares and squirrels.",
