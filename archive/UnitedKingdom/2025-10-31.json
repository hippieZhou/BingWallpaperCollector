  "description": "Tonight, Halloween casts its spell—and only a few places on Earth carry a mystery quite like Bran Castle in Romania. The fortress was built in the 14th century and has withstood wars, monarchs and shifting empires. But here, legends speak louder than history. Perched between the regions of Transylvania—renowned for its chilling tales—and Wallachia, once ruled by Vlad III Dracula, the castle evokes a haunting legacy. Vlad's ruthless reputation inspired Bram Stoker's 1897 novel 'Dracula.' Though the story is not set at Bran Castle, its looming form and persistent rumours of Vlad's presence blur fact and legend, forever linking it to one of humanity's most enduring tales.",
