  "description": "Ever tried spotting a snow leopard in the wild? It's called the 'ghost of the mountains' for a reason—you're more likely to see its pawprints than the big cat itself. It is sturdy and short-legged compared to other big cats, standing over 55 centimetres at the shoulder and measuring 75 to 150 centimetres from head to body.",
